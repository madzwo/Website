                <br>This was the final project in my Game Development class.
                <br>It was called the "Port-A-Project" as we were tasked with
                <br>porting a game from one game engin to another. I worked 
                <br>with my friend Jonathan Bowen on this project. We ported 
                <br>this game from Unreal Engine into Unity.

                <br>This is a prototype created during the lab section of my 
                <br>Game Development class. The task was to create a game where 
                <br>you can place objects in a 3D environment without the objects 
                <br>overlapping. I was always a fan of Bloons Tower Defense growing
                <br>up so I started to recreate it in 3D.

                <br>This was my final project in a class called Intro to Game 
                <br>Development and this was my first real game I created in Unity.
                <br>It was not requried, but I decided to create all of the assets 
                <br>for this project.

                <br>This was created during my senior year of high school. 
                <br>It was written in Java using a program called Eclipse
                <br>in a computer science class called Advanced Java. I 
                <br>always liked pokemon so I expanded on this project
                <br>substantially for fun.
